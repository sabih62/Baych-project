            <p id="para2">BAYC is a collection of 10,000 Bored Ape NFTs—unique digital collectibles living on the
                Ethereum
                blockchain. Your Bored Ape doubles as your Yacht Club membership card, and grants access to members-only
                benefits, the first of which is access to THE BATHROOM, a collaborative graffiti board. Future areas and
                perks can be unlocked by the community through roadmap activation.</p>

            <p>The apes are stored as ERC-721 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain and <br> hosted on IPFS. <a href="">
